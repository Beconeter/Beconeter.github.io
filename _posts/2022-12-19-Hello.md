I made this site!

Projects:

  - I made a blog for fun as if I was a youtuber who had coded his own blog [which is here i guess](https://bakos-blog.pages.dev) 
  - and I also made a Anarchy Bulletin board [here!](https://supacoolsmoothies.pages.dev).

I moved from gitlab to github because I wanted to.
